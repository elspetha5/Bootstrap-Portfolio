                            I never wanted to be a teacher. The pay is, in a phrase, not great, the amount of work involved seemed a bit thankless, and
                            to my younger, more pretentious self becoming a teacher felt like I was settling on something
                            easy. But after graduating with a degree in Psychology and not wanting to pursue more of that
                            I found a job as an instructional aid in a Kindergarten classroom and have now spent 10 years
                            of my life working in education. It has changed me. I am a better person because of it. And I
                            strive to live up to the incredibly dedicated colleagues around me.

                            Besides working in a field that mostly attracts people who are passionate about what they do, I also fulfilled one of my
                            lifelong goals last year by publishing a book. I took the self-publishing route which turned
                            out to be so creatively satisfying that I don't believe I would want to have done it any other
                            way. I am passionate about the projects I work on. Whether they are for the public eye or just
                            to hang in my house, I take great pride in doing a thing well and adding my own flare to it along
                            the way.
